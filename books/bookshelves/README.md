>"If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking." - Haruki Murakami

The aim here is to compile a list of books which have been recommended by great thinkers.

These lists are not exhaustive (feel free to leave comments with other recommendations on the relevant pages, though please provide proof of the recommendation of doing this).
