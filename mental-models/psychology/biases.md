# Cognitive Biases
#### TL;DR: Due to the way our brains work, there are a multitude of biases we tend to make.

## Description
The idea that the human brain evolved to solve problems whilst we were hunter-gatherers on the African Savannah has become so widely aspoused that it feels needless to mention at this point. However, it has such big implications for the way we make decisions that a discussion of human decision-making is fundamentally incomplete without this factor.

In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky laid out the way in which we think. With two systems:
* System 1: a reflexive, lightning fast decision-making tool which relies on impulses and heuristics to make snap judgments. This system was crucial to our survival as it's what gave us the ability to instantly decide whether to run away from or stand our ground against an approaching shape without stopping to think about whether it is in fact a bear.
* System 2: a reflective, slower paced but more accurate system that weighs up multiple factors and aims to arrive at more rational decisions.
