# Habits
#### TL;DR: You are what you repeatedly do.

## Description

James Clear wrote Atomic Habits, a bestselling book on behaviour change, which will act as the primary source for this description.

The fundamental aspects of behaviour change are:
* Environment design
* Awareness
* Reward systems
* Identity

## Applications
The applications of understanding how habits work are largely self-evident, but three aspects in particular deserve a special callout.

##### Environment design
Whether we're responsible for decorating our own home, building a website, or designing the layout of a supermarket, environment design has major consequences on our habits in two ways:
1. Influencing what we become aware of. As above, the first rule of behaviour change is awareness, so our environments should be designed to draw attention to the habits we want to instill. In David Goggins' autobiography he suggests an accountability mirror, where you stick post-it notes with small goals and making the habit of looking in it every day.
2. Influencing our desires through classical conditioning.
