# Influence & Persuasion
#### TL;DR: Influencing the decisions of other people relies largely on a subset of [our cognitive biases](https://github.com/interesting-git/worldly-wisdom/edit/main/mental-models/psychology/biases.md). Liking, reciprocation, social proof, authority, scarcity, consistency, and unity.

## Description
In his book, Influence, Robert Cialdini dives into how top salespeople figured out how to persuade people by making use of human beings' cognitive biases. His findings result in seven key factors that go into influencing a decision:

### 1. Likeability: People are more likely to comply with a request if they like you.
Obviously you'd be much more likely to do a favour for a friend than a stranger. Salespeople make use of this by being friendly and finding ways to build rapport. The average salesperson is going to take (feign) much more interest in your stories than your spouse or friends do.

### 2. Reciprocation: Giving someone something of value or doing them a favour before making your request will make them more likely to comply with your request as a way of repaying the favour.
An experiment by Dennis Regan in the 70s showed that the power of reciprocity could overpower liking as a predictor for behaviour. Giving someone something of value or doing them a favour before making a request can make them much more likely to comply with it.

### 3. Social proof: People are more likely to engage in behaviour they observe a lot of others engaging in.
This one is very powerful. People will do extreme things because of social proof. This is often misunderstood and leads to campaigns that highlight how many people are drinking and driving or not getting vaccinated. This inadvertently validates those choices using social proof.

### 4. Authority: People are much more likely to comply with figures they deem to have authority.
The Milgram Experiment is the most famous example. People are willing to harm or kill others because an authority figure told them to (although, as Charlie Munger pointed out in his critique of the common interpretation of the Milgram Experiment, there are a combination of cognitive biases working together to create that effect, not just authority).

### 5. Scarcity: When a resource is in short supply, people want it, and are willing to pay (much more) for it.
This is one of the most obvious yet most powerful ones used by businesses. Creating an artificial (or highlighting a real) scarcity of a desired resource. "There's another couple also interested in the house", "Only 1 room left at this price", "Limited tickets available".

This puts us in a panicked state of mind that promotes immediate action to prevent us missing out. A less benign example than booking a hotel room would be Black Friday. Between 2009-18, 11 people died and 109 were injured in the US due to Black Friday related incidents.

### 6. Consistency: People generally want to take actions which are consistent with their beliefs of their own identity.
There are two ways to view the consistency bias when thinking of influencing decisions: a) painting a picture of someone for them to be consistent with, and b) getting initial agreement and continuing with it.

##### a) A consistent image
Hinting that someone is a kind, knowledgeable person before asking for help can make them more likely to comply. For brands, showing yourself as consistent with your target market's values (e.g. Nike & Levi's marketing strategies) can drive more sales from that group as they wish to be consistent with their beliefs.

##### b) Commitment
How many subscriptions do you currently have which you haven't used since the last time you paid for them? People paying for gym memberships or app subscriptions they don't use is incredibly common (one estimate for [US gym subscriptions puts the percentage of unused memberships at 63%](https://thehustle.co/do-you-even-waste-money-bro/). Free trials are often described as influencing people through reciprocation, but the commitment bias resulting in us often continuing to subscribe to something after signing up whether or not we use it is a more likely reason for their adoption.

Similarly, it's a lot easier to upsell/upgrade someone to purchase a more expensive ticket when they've already made the decision to buy than it is to sell that higher priced item upfront.

### 7. Unity: People want to be consistent within their own beliefs and actions, but they also want to be consistent within the groups they identify with.
People are more easily influenced by someone local (geographically/culturally). People in the US are more likely to be convinced by Amazon reviews if the reviewer is from the same state and more likely to be willing to participate in research for universities in their home state.
