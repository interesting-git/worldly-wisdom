Through [influence and persuasion](https://github.com/interesting-git/worldly-wisdom/blob/main/mental-models/psychology/influence_and_persuasion.md) we learn how to put forward our propositions in a way that maximises the chances of a positive outcome.

Other people, however, will also be doing the same thing to a greater or lesser extent back at us. Our [cognitive biases](https://github.com/interesting-git/worldly-wisdom/blob/main/mental-models/psychology/biases.md) can lead us to make sub-optimal decisions if we don't account for them.

Similarly, understanding the most common logical fallacies can help us better understand whether a seemingly logical argument makes sense or just sounds good. Nowhere is this more important than in political discourse- whether it's analysing the statements made by our own governments, or being able to comprehend conflicting statements you see on twitter.
