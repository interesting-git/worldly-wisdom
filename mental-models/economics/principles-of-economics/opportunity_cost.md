# Opportunity Cost
#### TL;DR: The cost of something is what you give up to acquire it.
> *"Opportunity cost is a huge filter in life. If you've got two suitors who are really eager to have you and one is way the hell better than the other, you do not have to spend much time with the other. And that's the way we filter out buying opportunities."* - ***Charlie Munger***

## Description
When making trade-off decisions due to [scarce resources](https://github.com/interesting-git/worldly-wisdom/edit/main/mental-models/economics/principles-of-economics/scarcity.md), it’s not always obvious what the full cost of our decision is.

When deciding whether we want to buy a new book that helps us understand the science behind cooking great food (I recommend Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat) the initial cost is clear: $35. However, to understand the full cost, we need to take into account opportunity costs.

The first opportunity cost is the choice we’d be making to spend some of our money on a book, and not on going out for dinner, or perhaps putting the money in a savings account. We might consider ourselves very wealthy and think the cost of $35 is negligible, in which case the enjoyment we may get from the book may be worth a lot more to us than having the $35 in our bank account. But if we picture a $2000 holiday instead, it should be obvious that the opportunity cost of spending money on one thing instead of putting it to another use is very real indeed.

The second opportunity cost in this situation is the time we will spend reading the book. Let’s say it’ll take us roughly 5 hours to read our new book. We could be spending that time on another hobby, working extra hours, exercising, or even reading another book. Time is arguably our most scarce resource, so this cost is also very real!

Opportunity costs also often have consequences reaching into the future. Had we read Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, we may be able to enjoy much better home-cooked meals than we have been eating previously. As a result, between a book of the same price that we’d enjoy slightly more in the short-term, the correct choice for us may be to invest the time in this book to enhance our cooking ability and reap the rewards for a long time to come.

Because life is so complex, the full opportunity costs of a situation can usually never be known.

Had we read the cooking book, we may have discovered a passion for cooking we never knew we had and go on to become a Michelin Star Chef. Maybe if we’d taken our friend up on their offer for a meal out instead of spending the evening reading our book, we could have met the love of our life.

The best we can do is to take time to understand the different opportunity costs at play to minimise the risk that we’re missing a major one (especially by considering [second order effects](https://github.com/interesting-git/worldly-wisdom/blob/main/mental-models/economics/second_order_effects.md). Just being aware of the concept of opportunity costs is a major step in the right direction to making more rational decisions.

## Application
Ask yourself *"what else could I be spending this time/money/resource on?"* when committing to something.
