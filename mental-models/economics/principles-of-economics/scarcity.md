# Scarcity
#### TL;DR: As we don't have infinite resources, we have to make trade-off decisions.

## Description
People need to make trade-off decisions based on the fact that most resources are limited, including money and time.

Let’s consider a man, Ed, whose dream is to build his own large house in the quiet countryside. He’s been working as an economist in New York for a number of years and has managed to save up $1 million.

Clearly, Ed will be able to build a very nice house in a rural area for that much money. However, despite how rich he may feel with his $1 million, Ed’s not infinitely rich. He might be able to build a three-story, five-bedroom house with a decent home gym. He may even have enough money left over for a pool. If he wants to also add a standalone two-car garage, professionally landscaped garden, and a spa, he’s probably going to run out of money before he gets through that list.

His resources, in this case, his money, are scarce, and as a result, he needs to make a trade-off between his options.

**How should he decide between the uses for his money?** (Answer: [Opportunity cost](https://github.com/interesting-git/worldly-wisdom/new/main/mental-models/economics/principles-of-economics/opportunity_cost.md))

## Application
In [Influence & Persuasion](https://github.com/interesting-git/worldly-wisdom/blob/main/mental-models/psychology/influence_and_persuasion.md) we discussed how artificial (or real) scarcity is employed to encourage people to make snap decisions. When being sold something, ask yourself: ***is this real scarcity?***
