# Incentives
#### TL;DR: One of the best predictors of behaviour is the incentives that people have.
> *"Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives."* - ***Charlie Munger***

## Description
The idea that people make decisions based on their incentives sounds obvious, but not taking people’s incentives into account can lead to terrible policy decisions, whereas shaping a system to align someone’s incentives with a desired goal can drastically increase the chances that the goal is achieved, such as paying commission to salespeople to increase sales.

Considering the full impact of incentives often leads to surprising results. Sticking with the home selling theme, here’s an example from Wikipedia’s perverse incentives article:
>Real estate brokers have an inherent conflict of interest with sellers they represent because their usual commission structures motivate them to sell quickly rather than at a higher price. However, a broker representing a buyer has a distinct disincentive to negotiate a lower price on behalf of their client, because they will simultaneously be negotiating their own commission lower

In [Freakonomics](https://geni.us/zaaJ), the author explains how real estate agents tend to sell their own houses for more money than their clients’ houses. As explained above in the Wikipedia excerpt, when a real estate agent is only receiving a commission of a small percentage of the overall selling price, it’s often more profitable for them to sell at a lower price than spend time negotiating the price higher. Conversely, when selling their own house, a real estate agent would gain the full increase in the selling price, so they’d be incentivised to spend more time on the negotiation.

## Application
* When transacting with someone, ask yourself what their incentives are.
* When trying to encourage certain behaviours, design incentives that align with your end goal. Think through the [second-order effects](https://github.com/interesting-git/worldly-wisdom/blob/main/mental-models/economics/second_order_effects.md).
